      Numismacraft (latin for "Minecraft Coin Mod") is a Fabric mod for Minecraft Java Edition created by Eman7blue.

    <h4>
      What?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Yeah. So basically, I like coins. And I like Minecraft. Why not combine these two things and see what happens?
    </p>
    <h4>
      Huh?
    </h4>
    <p>
      I am currently adding most circulating United States coins from the late 19th century to today. Coins from other countries will come soon, with current plans for Euro coins and Canadian coins after that.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Buh?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Yeah I know this mod is very Western-centric, but I grew up collecting US coins and European coins. I do want every country's coinage in my mod (perhaps not all at once though, I need a solution for that).
    </p>
    <h4>
      Guh?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The code is on my github, but the release is not out yet.
